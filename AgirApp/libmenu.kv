This gives farmers much better harvest and more earnings as more crops can be grown on the same land with same resources that are used to grow single crop. The chances of total crop failure are very low.\nMany farmers have adopted this farming technique and are earning much more than before. The amazing thing is if you have 1 or 2 acre of land, still you can earn 8-10 lakhs in a year with Multi-Layer Farming."

The good thing is majority of them are not rural farmers, they are people living in metropolitan & urban cities. There are many successful hydroponics growers in India as well. Just do simple internet search & you will know how many success stories are there for this.\nBenefits of Hydroponics can be greater yields and less diseases in plants as some major ones are soil related.

                text:"[b]Introduction:[/b]\n\nThe grape is the most important crop grown in the world. Mostly it grown for making wines and preparation of raisin and then as a table fresh fruit. While in India, it is mainly grown for table use. Grape cultivation is believed to have originated near Caspian Sea, however, Indians know grapes since Roman times.Total area under grapes in India is about 40,000 ha, distributed mainly in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.\n\n[b]Climate:[/b]\n\nThe ideal climate for grape growing is the Mediterranean climate. In its natural habitat, the vines grow and produce during the hot and dry period. Under South Indian conditions – vines produce vegetative growth during the period from April to September and then fruiting period from October to March. Temperatures above 10 to 400C influence the yield and quality. High humidity and cloudy weather invite many fungal diseases, besides lowering the T.S.S. Acid ratio. "

About 700 to 900 Nitrogen, 400 to 600 Phosphorus and 750 to 1000 Potash Kgs/ha/y are applied to get about 30 to 35 tonnes produced yearly.The use of vermiphos, biomeal, mixtures of 5:10:5 ormichem, micronutrient mixtures have proved useful in grape production. Fertilizers are applied mainly twice in a year at the time of pruning, besides occasional foliar sprays are also practiced. Now-a days, Fertilization techniques is being popular in grape growers."
